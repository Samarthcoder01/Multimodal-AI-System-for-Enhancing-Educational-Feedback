# Multimodal AI System for Enhancing Educational Feedback

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a multimodal AI system that integrates computer vision and natural language processing to enhance feedback mechanisms in educational environments. The system analyzes real-time classroom interactions to provide personalized insights for students and teachers.

## Features
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Monitors student behavior during classes using object detection techniques.
- **Personalized Feedback**: Generates tailored insights and suggestions based on detected behaviors.
- **Improved Engagement**: Enhances teaching strategies and fosters a more interactive learning atmosphere.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Computer Vision**: YOLO, Faster R-CNN (for object detection)
- **Natural Language Processing**: GPT-4 (for generating feedback)
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras
